# Advanced-Unix-Programming-Exercises
My solutions to some of the exercises from the Book "Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment (Third Edition)" by W. Richard Stevens and Stephen A. Rago. This solutions are written in C and testet/compiled under a linux-system, kernel version 
6.1.

## Chapter 1
### Exercise 1.1:
Verify on your system that the directories dot and dot-dot are not the same, except in the root directory. -> [dot-dotdot.c](dot-dotdot.c)

### Exercise 1.4:
If the calendar time is stored as a signed 32-bit integer, in which year will it overflow? How can we extend the overflow point? -> [calendarti-overf.c](calendarti-overf.c)

### Exercise 1.5:
If the process time is stored as a signed 32-bit integer, and if the system counts 100 ticks per second, after how many days will the value overflow? -> [procti-overf.c](procti-overf.c)

## Chapter 2
